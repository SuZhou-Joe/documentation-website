After clicking any button, a modal will pop up. In the dropdown menu of the target workspace, you can choose which workspace to copy assets to. Checking `Copy related assets` will copy all assets related to the selected assets into the workspace together.

## Delete your workspace

Deleting a workspace will remove all assets(except data source) within it and the workspace itself. This operation cannot be undone, and all assets will be permanently deleted.

To delete a workspace, you must be a dashboard administrator. Otherwise, the delete icon will not be visible. See [how to configure dashboard administrators]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/dashboards/workspace/workspace-acl/#config-dashboard-admin) for more information.

There are two ways to delete a workspace:

1. On the workspace detail page:
 - Click the red trash icon in the top right corner to delete the current workspace.

 - Or, select multiple workspaces and use the bulk delete option.
